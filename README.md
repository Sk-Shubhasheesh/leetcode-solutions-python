# leetcode-solutions-python

Solutions implemented in python for [leetcode algorithms](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/).

The file name organized in the following format:

{problem number}-{problem title}_{version}.py

The version is optional.

# Run test

Add a test.py file as framework to all solution.

There are two way to run it.

    python test.py

This will run the test for the latest modified code file.

    python test.py {issue_number}

This will run the test for specific solution of the issue_number

For example:
